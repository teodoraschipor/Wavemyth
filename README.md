For this React test I used **html**, **sass** for styling, **js**, **redux** for application state. I also implemented the carousel by adding random/extra images and texts, navigation/routing using **react-router-dom** and a simple **responsive design**.  

You can see the requested page by clicking **"Destinations"** from the menu bar or by **"/destinations"** url.  

**To run this project, you need to download the sourcecode. After this, make sure to install npm, react-router-dom, sass, react-redux.**  

You can use these commands:  

**npm i**  
**npm i react-router-dom**  
**npm i sass**  
**npm i react-redux**
